# Intro to Speedrunning
Speedrunning is playing video games with a goal of completing them as quickly as possible.

Speedrunning often manifests as an ongoing global competition of players trying to achieve the fastest ever time for a game, but it can also be done in simultaneous races with a group of competitors, done on stream to showcase a speedrun for entertainment, or done on one's own as challenge to achieve one's personal best time.

When starting to speedrun a game for the first time, I recommend starting off viewing it as a challenge against yourself. Set an initial time, then see how much you can continue to improve that time with practice and better strategies. Competition with others can be fun for many people, but it's not necessary to enjoy the hobby.


# Components of a Speedrun
There are four main phases of developing a speedrun:

**(1) Game Knowledge**: Understanding a game's behavior. For example:
* Knowing all ways to obtain a particular item 
* Knowing how NPCs react to various stimuli
* Knowing a glitch that will displace your character's position, moving them without collision

**(2) Speed Tech**: Developing general techniques for moving quickly. For example:
* Using a certain pattern of jumping/rolling/strafing to move as quickly as possible 
* Performing a certain series of actions to manipulate an enemy to miss their attacks or fall off a ledge
* Using a character displacement glitch to pass through a certain wall

**(3) Routing**: Planning a specific path and set of strategies to use during a run of the game leveraging game knowledge and tech.

**(4) Execution**: Competitively performing a route.

All four phases play a part in getting fast times, an improvement in any phase will yield an advantage.

Some people may engage with all phases, but most people may just do one or two and rely on other people for the rest. Many speedrunners learn the tech and route that others have developed and focus on trying to master their execution. Others prefer the puzzle aspect of speedrunning: focusing on glitch hunting, investigating game files, and theorycrafting route optimizations more than grinding for perfect execution or even running the game at all


# Rules & Categories
The community of speedrunners for each game establishes sets of rules to follow so that runners are competing on equal terms. Most games' leaderboards will have a few different rulesets, called categories. There are some common category types that will be found across many games, although specifics may change from game to game:

* **100%** - Complete every task available in the game (collect all items, finish all side quests, etc.)
* **Any%** - Reach the end of the game by any means possible.
* **Glitchless** - Complete the game without the use of glitches. 
* **No Major Glitches** - Complete the game without using major glitches (minor glitches are allowed).

What could be considered a glitch or a major glitch is subjective. What things are included or not should be defined in the ruleset for the category.

There are several things that are [prohibited](https://www.speedrun.com/knowledgebase/site-rules) by default for all games:
* Modifying game files
* Splicing gameplay from multiple playthroughs to appear as a single playthrough
* Playing at a slowed speed then speeding up the footage 
* Having inputs done by anything or anyone other than the listed player (e.g. programmed inputs)
* Etc.

Submitting a run with a prohibited element is cheating, and doing this intentionally is considered a serious offense. The unfortunate reality that some people choose to cheat entails that run times will need a certain level of proof and verification as determined by the community. Most game leaderboards just require a video recording of a reasonable quality, but may require more.

These rules just apply to competitions between players for standing on leaderboards. Use any ruleset you think will be the most fun when you're running on your own. 


# Leaderboards
Many websites have been used to record times achieved over speedrunning's history. Currently [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/) is the predominant leaderboard website used for most games.

Some games, especially games or series with a long history, have their own websites used as the main leaderboard, such as [mkleaderboards.com](https://www.mkleaderboards.com/) for Mario Kart leaderboards or [the-elite.net](https://www.the-elite.net/) for Goldeneye & Perfect Dark leaderboards.


# Speedrunning Events
There are loads of in-person and virtual events within the speedrunning community, specifically marathons where players showcase speedruns of their games with live commentary.

The largest of these is [Games Done Quick](https://gamesdonequick.com/) which takes place biannually (AGDQ & SGDQ) and is a charity event where viewers may donate to have a comment read live.


# TAS
A popular alternative to typical, human-player speedruns are TASes (Tool-Assisted Speedruns). This is where someone configures a computer program with a series of inputs to enter into a game. This allows for perfectly executed runs with techniques that are too difficult for human players to perform.

TASes have their own [site](https://www.tasvideos.org).


# Challenge Runs
Speedrunning is just one of many ways to breathe new life into a game with a self-imposed challenge. Here are some other types of challenges:


## High Score
Achieve the highest score possible in a game. This generally only applies to games that feature a score, which tend to be older games.

Examples:
* StarFox 64, High Score
* Pokemon Snap, High Score - Highest photo rating for a given pokemon (e.g. Porygon)


## Low%
This is a very broad term for any challenge to achieve the least amount possible while still completing a game. This focuses around minimizing one parameter, whether it's a score or the number of times a particular action is taken.

Examples:
* Banjo-Kazooie, Minimum Jumps
* Sly Cooper, Minimum Coins


## No Hit
Complete a game without taking any damage.

Example:
* Dark Souls, No Hit


## Hardcore Difficulty
Complete a game with the hardest difficulty settings possible.

Example:
* Halo 2, LASO - Legendary difficulty, all skulls on
* Starcraft II, 1v7 Insane AI - Beat a multiplayer game against 7 Insane difficulty AI all teamed up against you.


## Trick Shot
Perform a sequence of actions that results in some cool effect. 

Example:
* Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Trick Shots


## Mods
Community-created mods are created for games to change some aspect of them.

Example:
* Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Randomizer - The contents of every chest in the game are randomly swapped around


## Challenge Run Speedruns
Any of the above challenges can be made into a speedrun category. Runs are ranked firstly by the challenge criteria, and secondly by time taken.

For example, consider that there are 3 submitted runs for Minimum Captures in Super Mario Odyssey:
* A. 5 captures used, 3 hours
* B. 5 captures used, 2 hours
* C. 4 captures used, 8 hours

The ranking of these runs will be:
1. C
2. B
3. A

B has a better time than A with the same amount of captures, so it's ranked higher.

Although C takes a much longer time than B, it achieved a better result in the primary challenge criteria so it's ranked higher.
