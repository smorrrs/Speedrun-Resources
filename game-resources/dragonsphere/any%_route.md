# Any% Route

### Castle
* Go south and talk to brother
* Go south and talk to wife and mom
* Take sword
* Take shieldball
* Invoke signet ring


### Desert
* Get directions from trader
  - "No" > "Yes"
  - Directions
      - shab = north
      - falla = south
      - ecliptus = west
* Navigate desert according to directions
* Talk to shaman
  - "I don't understand your language.."
  - "...defeat sanwe..."
  - Given powerstone
* Invoke signet ring

Note: The desert path is randomized. It's not strictly necessary to talk to the trader for directions if you are able to guess correctly.

Note: Skip the caliph during the first visit to the desert. You need to win 5 gem games to get all required items, but he'll only give you up to 3 as Callash. Furthermore, as Callash you'll need to either be flattering and watch the dancer cutscene, or be unflattering and have to win 3 games for each prize. As Pid, you always win 1 prize per win and don't have to watch the dancer.


### Fairy Land
* Talk to fairy
  - All polite answers (bottom, bottom, top)
* Talk to each fairy while red until you find Ralph
  - "Is it safe to cross?"
* Talk to Butterfly King
  - Pass first quiz
      - "Anyone" > "I don't know" > "Trouble" > "Callash" > "challenge authority"
  - Given powerstone
  - Skip through second quiz
      - Select all bottom responses to fail
* Invoke signet ring

Note: sprite locations are randomized.

Note: Talking to the shak is unnecessary to get the belt, meaning that the bird statue and bird call are skippable. As such, it's slightly faster to fail the second quiz and skip getting the statue.

  - ... > "can I give you something" > "not a bribe"
* Give them any item except for shieldball
