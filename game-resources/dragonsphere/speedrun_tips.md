# Speedrun Tech

## Right Clicking
The right-click action can be set by right-clicking an action verb. Set and use right-click actions when re-using the same action multiple times in short succession.

# Mashing
Spamming clicks to move will move your character faster.



# Routing Tips

## Signet Teleport
Using the signet ring to teleport to the market is almost always a faster way to get to your next destination whenever you're done with an area compared to leaving normally.

## Crystal Ball
The crystal ball can be used once to resolve one of many events throughout the game without the required item:
* Open the ward below the well (no other item can do this)
* Restore king's soul without the soul egg
* Break ice around the king without the shifter ring
* Pacify beast without the parchment
* Get crown without the flies
* Distract roc without the dates or taking magic from the grapes
* Traverse snake pit without the shifter ring
* Heal Ilanie without the doll

Can't be used to:
* Heal Ilanie without the spirit bundle or speaking the love poem
* Drug guards without sopophoric
* Swim across the well river without the shifter ring
* Defeat MacMorn without the sword or amulet

Any%: Use it to heal the king. Skips the soul egg, visiting the spirit plane, and making the 2nd spirit bundle.
100%: Use it on the ward below the well to get the emerald.
Bad Ending: Use it on the catacomb beast. Skips the parchment, healing Ilanie, and making the 2nd spirit bundle.
Low%: Both the Any% and Bad Ending routes yield the lowest known score of 180 points.

## Optional Items
Many items and actions in the game only yield points and serve no function for progressing the game. These are skipped for Any% but are needed for 100%.

Optional Items
* Goblet (castle dining hall)
* Rare coin (bottom of the well)
* Emerald (behind ward at the bottom of the well)
* Crystal flower (near giant frogs)
* Gold nugget (near hermit cave)
* Music box (tower in same room as vortex ball)

## Item Sorting
Whenever an item enters your inventory it gets added to the end of the list. You have some influence over the sequence that items get obtained which will affect where they will be in the list when you later go to use them.
