# Intro to Speedrunning
Speedrunning is playing video games with a goal of completing them as quickly as possible.

Speedrunning often manifests as an ongoing global competition of players trying to achieve the fastest ever time for a game, but it can also be done in simultaneous races with a group of competitors, done in private as challenge to achieve one's personal best time, or done on stream to showcase a speedrun for entertainment.

# Leaderboards
Many websites have been used to record times achieved over speedrunning's history. Currently [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/) is the predominant leaderboard website used for most games.

Some games, especially games or series with a long history, have their own websites used as the main leaderboard, such as [mkleaderboards.com](https://www.mkleaderboards.com/) for Mario Kart leaderboards or [the-elite.net](https://www.the-elite.net/) for Goldeneye & Perfect Dark leaderboards.
