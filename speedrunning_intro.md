# Intro to Speedrunning
Speedrunning is playing video games with a goal of completing them as quickly as possible.

Speedrunning often manifests as an ongoing global competition of players trying to achieve the fastest ever time for a game, but it can also be done in simultaneous races with a group of competitors, done on one's own as challenge to achieve one's personal best time, or done on stream to showcase a speedrun for entertainment.


# Rules & Categories
The community of speedrunners for each game establishes sets of rules to follow so that runners are competing on equal terms. Most games' leaderboards will have a few different rulesets, called categories. Although specifics may change from game to game, there are some common category types that will be found across many games:

**100%** - Complete every task available in the game (collect all items, finish all side quests, etc.)
**Any%** - Reach the end of the game by any means possible.
**Glitchless** - Complete the game without the use of glitches. 
**No Major Glitches** - Complete the game without using major glitches (minor glitches are allowed).

What could be considered a glitch or a major glitch is subjective. What things are included or not should be defined in the ruleset for the category.

There are several things that are widely [prohibited](https://www.speedrun.com/knowledgebase/site-rules) across all categories of all games:
* Modifying game files
* Splicing gameplay from multiple playthroughs to appear as a single playthrough
* Playing at a slowed speed then speeding up the footage 
* Having inputs done by anything or anyone other than the listed player (e.g. programmed inputs)
* Etc.

Submitting a run with a prohibited element is cheating, and doing this intentionally is considered a serious offense. The unfortunate reality that some people choose to cheat entails that run times will need to have a certain level of proof and verification as determined by the community. Most game leaderboards require a video recording of a reasonable quality, but may require more.

This all just applies to competitions between players for standing on leaderboards. Feel free to run any ruleset you think will be fun to run on your own. With enough interest from others, 

TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedrun) are a good example of this

# Leaderboards
Many websites have been used to record times achieved over speedrunning's history. Currently [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/) is the predominant leaderboard website used for most games.

Some games, especially games or series with a long history, have their own websites used as the main leaderboard, such as [mkleaderboards.com](https://www.mkleaderboards.com/) for Mario Kart leaderboards or [the-elite.net](https://www.the-elite.net/) for Goldeneye & Perfect Dark leaderboards.
