# PC Games
For PC games, this software is all you'll need apart from your computer and the game itself.

What Source to use for capturing game footage in OBS depends on the type of game:

Most games are full screen applications by default. For these, select **Game Capture** as the Source. With this setting, OBS will detect any full screen applications that open up (with a delay of several seconds).

Some games, especially games running in an emulator, aren't full screen. For these, select **Window Capture** then select the game's window (the game must be running for it to appear). 


# Console Games
For console games, you'll additionally need have the following:
* A **computer with an HDMI port**
* For old consoles: a **converter** from console output cable type to HDMI (example: N64 will need [AV-to-HDMI](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=av+converter+to+hdmi&gclid=Cj0KCQjwk7ugBhDIARIsAGuvgPY_gQmQiJgoLbiXheJbOZKka1Tc0lMbhItesXaH6sPgAgCps-gYO0UaAnVhEALw_wcB&hvadid=177292155109&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9033309&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=16403810708644509553&hvtargid=kwd-26528964897&hydadcr=18911_9698412&tag=googhydr-20&ref=pd_sl_9frq3im3x7_e))

With this, you can plug the HDMI output of the console into your computer, which can both display the game and capture it with OBS.

If you want to play the game on a TV as most normally would, on top of all of the above you'll need:
* **Capture card**: These can be a bit pricey. I use an [EVGA XR1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09D8VYLY7?linkCode=ogi&tag=pop-lift-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10060.g.36003491%5Bsrc%7Carb_ga_pop_d_bm_comm_org_us_g36003491%5Bch%7C6478e683e49cfca27a82dfbc1a8acc90%5Blt%7Cpsv%5Bpid%7C82f8073b-d32d-40d6-ab32-3a26aa72f514&th=1) which is on the cheaper end and it works great.
* **TV with an HDMI port**

To use the capture card, the console output HDMI cord will be plugged into the capture card. One cord will connect the capture card to the TV, to display the game. Another cord will connect the capture card to a computer running OBS to capture the footage.
