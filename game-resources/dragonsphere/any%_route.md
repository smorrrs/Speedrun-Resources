Note: The desert path is randomized. It's not strictly necessary to talk to the trader for directions if you were able to guess correctly.

Note: Skip the caliph during the first visit to the desert. You need to win 5 gem games to get all required items, but he'll only give you up to 3 as Callash. Furthermore, as Callash you'll need to either be flattering and watch the dancer cutscene, or be unflattering and have to win 3 games for each prize. As Pid, you always win 1 prize per win and don't have to watch the dancer.
