For PC games, this software is all you'll need apart from your computer and the game itself.

For console games, you'll additionally need to purchase a capture card, which reads the HDMI feed from your console to your TV (or other display) and sends it to your computer to get recorded by the recording software.

Capture card

Must use a modern TV with an HDMI input.

For modern consoles that connect to a TV with an HDMI cable, instead of connecting the console directly to the TV, you'll attach the console to the capture card (HDMI to HDMI cable) then attach the capture card to the TV (HDMI to HDMI cable). Another cable will attach your capture card to a computer which will be running the screen capture software.

For old consoles that don't use HDMI, you'll additionally need a converter from its cable type to HDMI.
