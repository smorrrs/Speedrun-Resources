For PC games, this software is all you'll need apart from your computer and the game itself.

For console games, you'll additionally need to purchase a capture card, which reads the HDMI feed from your console to your TV (or other display) and sends it to your computer to get recorded by the recording software.

# PC Game Recording
What Source to use for capturing game footage depends on the type of game:

Most games are full screen applications by default. For these, select **Game Capture** as the source. With this setting, OBS will detect any full screen applications that open up (with a delay of several seconds).

Some games, especially games run within emulators, aren't full screen. For these, select **Window Capture** then select the game's window (the game must be running for it to appear). 



# Console Game Recording

Capture card

Must use a modern TV with an HDMI input.

For modern consoles that connect to a TV with an HDMI cable, instead of connecting the console directly to the TV, you'll attach the console to the capture card (HDMI to HDMI cable) then attach the capture card to the TV (HDMI to HDMI cable). Another cable will attach your capture card to a computer which will be running the screen capture software.

For old consoles that don't use HDMI, you'll additionally need a converter from its cable type to HDMI.
